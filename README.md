## Siemens-LOGO-Workshop

This workshop demonstrates the connection of Siemens LOGO! PLC and Node - Red web based framework. As a demonstration task, this simple demonstration refers to the control of an industrial greenhouse. Based on the available hardware, basic bool logic has been solved, for basic control and demonstration of the power of Node - Red.


## Technology

```bash

+--------------------+                        +----------------+
| LOGO! PLC          |     <-- Snap7 -->      |  Node-Red      |
+--------------------+                        +----------------+


```

## Case

Individual sensors and control parts (temp. sensors, motors, etc.) are connected to the Logo! This control unit then communicates with Node-Red using Snap7 communication where the control logic is designed with one-touch web-based visualization.
